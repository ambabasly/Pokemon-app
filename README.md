- the JavaScript code can be manually formatted. 
- the app must use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or touch interactions.
- the app may enable searching for items (e.g., searching for Pokémon).
- the app should not trigger errors when used.
- the app should be deployed on a publicly available platform such as GitHub Pages.
